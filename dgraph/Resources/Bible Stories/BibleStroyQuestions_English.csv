However, God did not merely send a prophet to Zechariah. Instead, he sent one of his mighty angels.

12	Paul Becomes a follower of Jesus	As the Jews continued to persecute the believers, God did an amazing thing. He chose to set apart Saul, one of the worst persecutors of the church, and cause him to preach boldly about Jesus! He appeared to Saul on the road in blazing light, rebuked him, and made Saul blind. As a result, Saul believed in Jesus and began to boldly proclaim his name. When the Jews drove him out of Damascus, he went to Jerusalem and continued to preach there. Later, he went with Barnabas to Antioch and taught the first believers who were not Jews. And finally, God told the church at Antioch to send out Barnabas and Saul to preach to other people groups everywhere. God continued to spread the message of Jesus.	<<QUESTION>>: What did Saul do to the believers in Jerusalem?<<ANSWER>>: He persecuted them by going from house to house to arrest both men and women and put them in prison  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Saul go to the city of Damascus?<<ANSWER>>: The high priest gave Saul permission to go to Damascus to arrest the followers of Jesus there and bring them back to Jerusalem  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What happened to Saul as he was traveling to Damascus?<<ANSWER>>: A bright light shone around him and he heard someone say, “Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?”  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who did God send to Saul so that he could see again?<<ANSWER>>: God sent a disciple in Damascus named Ananias to Saul to make him see again  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who did Saul tell the Jews in Damascus that Jesus was?<<ANSWER>>: Saul told them that Jesus was the Son of God and the Messiah  .|||<<QUESTION>>: How did Saul escape from the Jews in Damascus when they wanted to kill him?<<ANSWER>>: Saul’s friends lowered him over the city wall in a basket at night so he could escape  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What happened when Saul tried to meet with the apostles in Jerusalem?<<ANSWER>>: The apostles were afraid of Saul until Barnabas took him to them and explained how Saul had boldly preached about Jesus in Damascus  .|||<<QUESTION>>: How were the believers in Antioch different from the believers in Jerusalem?<<ANSWER>>: The believers in Antioch were not Jews  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who did the Holy Spirit tell the followers of Jesus in Antioch to set apart to do God’s work in other places?<<ANSWER>>: The Holy Spirit told them to set apart Barnabas and Saul to do God’s work, so they sent them out  . |||<<QUESTION>>: What was Saul’s attitude about the believers before the Lord appeared to him?<<ANSWER>>: Saul hated the believers and tried to destroy them. He guarded the robes of the people who killed Stephen. Later, he arrested believers throughout Jerusalem, and planned to do the same thing in Damascus. He was perhaps the least likely person we would expect God to save and use for his glory.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think Jesus told Saul that he was persecuting Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus was already in heaven when Saul began to persecute the believers. But the believers represented Jesus on earth, so when Saul persecuted them, it was as if he was persecuting Jesus himself. Jesus cares about what happens to the believers.|||<<QUESTION>>: What did God tell Ananias that he had chosen Saul to do?<<ANSWER>>: God told Ananias that he had chosen Saul to declare his name to the Jews and to people from other people groups, and to suffer in God’s name. Even though Saul had hated the believers and persecuted them, God had a plan to use Saul to spread the good news about Jesus throughout the world of that day.|||<<QUESTION>>: What happened in Damascus when Saul preached about Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Saul argued boldly with the Jews to prove that Jesus was the Son of God. However, it is not clear if many people believed. Perhaps arguing about Jesus is not the best way to convince people to repent of their sin. After a time, the Jews tried to kill Saul, and he had to escape at night.|||<<QUESTION>>: Who went to Antioch to teach the new believers there?<<ANSWER>>: The two people who went to teach the believers at Antioch were Barnabas and Saul. Saul was the one who God said he would send to people of other nations, such as the people at Antioch. And Barnabas was the one who spoke for Saul and convinced the apostles in Jerusalem to accept him. Both men were uniquely prepared to teach people who were not Jews.|||<<QUESTION>>: How did the Holy Spirit send out Barnabas and Saul?<<ANSWER>>: The Holy Spirit spoke to the believers in the church at Antioch in order to send out Barnabas and Saul. The church then prayed for them, placed their hands on them, and supported them as they went out to preach among the other people groups. God did not send them out alone. Instead, he worked through the church so the believers were deeply involved in the work of Barnabas and Saul.|||
13	The Rich Young Ruler	The rich young ruler who came to Jesus genuinely wanted to receive eternal life. He thought that he had obeyed God enough to be worthy of eternal life. Jesus loved him, but also knew that the young man loved his possessions. Therefore, Jesus tested him by telling him to give up his possessions and to follow Jesus in order to have eternal life.

God considers that we sin if we fail to obey even one of his laws. The young man wrongly thought that God would accept him if he faithfully obeyed some of God’s most important laws.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Jesus talk to the young man about being perfect?<<ANSWER>>: The young man wrongly thought he could be ***good enough*** to have eternal life.

The only way for him to be perfect was to follow Jesus and trust that Jesus would save him from his sin.|||<<QUESTION>>: If the young man wanted to have eternal life, why was he not willing to give up his possessions?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus promised that the young man would have treasure in heaven if he followed Jesus. However, the young man could not yet see and touch that treasure. He had to believe that Jesus would reward him. However, he could easily see and touch the possessions that he already had in this world. Therefore, it was hard for him to give up his current treasure to gain something that he could not yet see. |||<<QUESTION>>: Why were the disciples so shocked to hear that it was almost impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven?<<ANSWER>>: The people of that day believed that if God loved someone, he made them wealthy. The more possessions a person had, the more people thought God loved them. The disciples were shocked to hear that God does not necessarily accept a person who is rich.|||<<QUESTION>>: When will Jesus reward his disciples for giving up things for his sake?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus does not say when he will reward his disciples. He may give them some things in this life, but most of their reward will be in heaven. Jesus clearly told his disciples that he would give them 100 times as much as they give up for him in this life. Other people may think they are poor in this life, but Jesus will richly reward them in his kingdom.|||

He tore down his father’s altar at night because he was afraid of the people. God had to show him two signs to convince him to attack the Midianites.

In spite of his fear, God used him to save Israel.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did God make Gideon send home all but 300 soldiers?<<ANSWER>>: God wanted everyone to know that the Israelites defeated the Midianites because God helped them.

Instead, they wanted a king like all the other nations had. |||

18	Paul and Silas in Philippi	Paul never forgot that God saved him from persecuting the believers and enabled him to proclaim the message about Jesus to people in many different people groups. Because God was so gracious to him, Paul was willing to go anywhere for God, and to praise him even when he was suffering. As a result, God used Paul powerfully to preach to people in many cities throughout the world. In addition, Paul wrote many letters to believers in different cities to teach and encourage them.

She knew about God, but she did not know about Jesus. When Paul and Silas told her about Jesus, she believed in him and was baptized. It is not enough for a person to believe in God.

19	Jesus Raises Lazarus from the Dead	Jesus honored God with everything he did. He was not afraid of people who wanted to kill him. He was willing to allow Lazarus to die even though it made Martha, Mary, and Jesus himself very sad. The most important thing was to honor God. As a result, Martha, Mary, the disciples, and many others saw God work powerfully through Jesus to raise Lazarus to life again.

Instead, Jesus healed the man because Peter and John believed in Jesus. Peter and John were very humble about the way God used them.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Peter tell the crowd that they killed Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: People cannot be saved if they do not repent.

The people there had become very evil and worshiped many idols.|||<<QUESTION>>: What often happens to people who live among people that worship other gods?<<ANSWER>>: God said the Israelites would begin to worship the idols of the Canaanites if they lived with them. People normally begin to worship the gods of the people around them. This is especially true if they marry people who believe in other gods.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Joshua give the people different advice than the other ten spies?<<ANSWER>>: All 12 of the spies saw the same land and people.

God decided this before they were born.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why was Jacob holding on to Esau’s heel?<<ANSWER>>: Later on, Jacob would take Esau’s place by receiving the honor and possessions that should belong to the firstborn son.

30	The Story of the Good Samaritan	The expert in the law who came to Jesus did not believe in Jesus, and he did not really understand God’s law. Instead, he wanted to embarrass Jesus. Jesus knew this, and so he questioned the man about the law. He then told a story that showed how a follower of God should treat other people.

Although the man was a stranger from a people that the Samaritans hated, he felt compassion for him. He took care of the man, doing more than was necessary or expected to help him. He treated the injured man as he would like to be treated himself if he was in need. This is what it means to be a neighbor to someone.|||

33	God Raises Jesus from the Dead	Jesus had told the disciples and other people the he would become alive again after three days. Surprisingly, the disciples did not remember this, nor come to the tomb to see if he would rise again. Only the women came, and even they did not expect Jesus to be alive. The only people who seemed to remember that he promised to rise again were the unbelieving religious leaders. They remembered what Jesus said, and tried to stop people from believing that he would rise from the dead. They posted soldiers to make sure his body remained in the tomb. But they could not stop the plan of God. An angel struck down the soldiers, and Jesus rose with power.	<<QUESTION>>: What were the Jewish leaders afraid the disciples would do with the body of Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: They were afraid the disciples would steal Jesus’ body and say he had risen from the dead  .|||<<QUESTION>>: How did Pilate make sure the disciples could not steal Jesus’ body?<<ANSWER>>: Pilate let them placed a seal on the entrance of the tomb, and also stationed some soliders there to guard it.  .|||<<QUESTION>>: When did the women come to the tomb?<<ANSWER>>: The women came to the tomb after the Sabbath day was over  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the woman plan to do at the tomb?<<ANSWER>>: The women wanted to put more spices on Jesus’ body  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who rolled the stone away from the tomb?<<ANSWER>>: An angel from heaven rolled the stone away from the tomb  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the soldiers do when they saw the angel?<<ANSWER>>: The soldiers were so afraid that they fell to the ground like dead men  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the angel tell the women had happened to Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: The angel told them that Jesus was not there, but that he had risen from the dead  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the angel tell the women to say to the disciples?<<ANSWER>>: He told them to tell the disciples that Jesus had risen from the dead, and would go ahead of them to Galilee  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the women do when Jesus appeared to them as they were on their way?<<ANSWER>>: The woman fell down and worshiped Jesus  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who was it that remembered Jesus’ promise to rise from the dead in three days?<<ANSWER>>: It is surprising that the disciples did not remember the Jesus said he would rise from the dead in three days.

The disciples should have remembered.|||<<QUESTION>>: Were the soldiers able to prevent the tomb from opening?<<ANSWER>>: The Roman soldiers were the best soldiers of that time. However, they could not stand against the single angel that God sent to open the tomb. The strongest military force could not stop God from doing what he planned to do. When the angel appeared, they fell down like dead men.|||<<QUESTION>>: How did the angel treat the women who came to the tomb?<<ANSWER>>: The angel knew that the women had come to honor Jesus by putting spices on his body. Therefore, the angel spoke kindly to them and told them not to be afraid. He showed them the empty tomb, and told them that Jesus would meet them in Galilee.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think Jesus met the women, when he told them the same thing as the angel?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus did not need to appear to the women. The angel had already told them that he was alive and would meet the disciples in Galilee. But Jesus also knew that the women had come to honor him. Perhaps he appears to them for that reason, so he could honor them for coming to serve him. The women were therefore the first people to see Jesus after he became alive again. |||
34	The Prophets	God always sent prophets to tell the Israelites to worship only him. But the people hated the prophets and refused to listen to them. They served idols instead of Yahweh. They even tried to kill the prophets whom God sent to them. But the prophets continued to speak for God, and God continued to care for his prophets. The prophets warned the people to repent or God would punish them. Even so, God still promised that he would send the Messiah to them.	<<QUESTION>>: Why did King Ahab try to kill the prophet Elijah?<<ANSWER>>: Ahab was angry with Elijah because Elijah said there would be no rain in the kingdom of Israel.

God took care of Elijah because Elijah obeyed God and spoke God’s messages to the people.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Elijah tell the people to pour water on his sacrifice?<<ANSWER>>: Elijah told the people to pour water on his sacrifice in order to make it harder for it to burn.

35	Jesus Is Crucified	Jesus suffered greatly as he died. The soldiers mocked and mistreated him. The religious leaders and the crowd mocked him. Even one of the robbers on a cross beside him mocked him. Despite this, Jesus remained on the cross and suffered in order to make a way for God to forgive sinners. He was willing to die in order to obey his Father and finish the task that he came to do. One of the robbers understood this, and went to heaven with Jesus. One of the soldiers also saw that Jesus was truly the Son of God. And two of the religious leaders believed in Jesus and honored him by burying his body. God was honored even through the death of his Son.	<<QUESTION>>: What did the soldiers force Jesus to carry?<<ANSWER>>: They forced him to carry the cross on which he would die  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did Jesus ask his Father to do for the soldiers who crucified him?<<ANSWER>>: He asked his Father to forgive them, for they did not understand what they were doing  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the sign above Jesus’ head say?<<ANSWER>>: The sign said **King of the Jews**  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did Jesus promise to the robber who asked Jesus to remember him?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus promised him that he would be with Jesus that very day in Paradise  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the Jewish leaders and people in the crowd tell Jesus to do so that they might believe in him?<<ANSWER>>: They told Jesus to come down from the cross and to save himself  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What happened to the sky as Jesus was on the cross?<<ANSWER>>: The sky became completely dark for three hours in the middle of the day  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did Jesus cry out to his Father as he died?<<ANSWER>>: He said that it was finished, and gave his spirit into his Father’s hands  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What happened to the curtain in the Temple when Jesus died?<<ANSWER>>: The curtain was torn in two from the top to the bottom  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What did the the Roman soldier say about Jesus when he died?<<ANSWER>>: The soldier said the Jesus was certainly innocent, and that he was the Son of God  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Who buried Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Two Jewish leaders named Joseph and Nicodemus buried Jesus  .|||<<QUESTION>>: How did Joseph close the tomb?<<ANSWER>>: He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb to block the entrance  .|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think Jesus said the soldiers did not know what they were doing?<<ANSWER>>: The soldiers were Romans who did not know very much about the Jewish religion. They probably thought Jesus was an ordinary criminal, and they treated him as one.|||<<QUESTION>>: They soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing. Why does that help us believe Jesus was the Messiah?<<ANSWER>>: This action was one of many things that the scriptures, written hundreds of years before, said they would do to the Messiah. All these prophesies were fulfilled in Jesus.|||<<QUESTION>>: Jesus told the robber who repented that he would be with Jesus in Paradise that day. What does that tell us about the way to enter into heaven?<<ANSWER>>: The robber did not perform a single good deed. Instead, he simply confessed that he was a sinner, and asked Jesus to remember him in the kingdom. As a result, Jesus promised that he would be in Paradise (that is, heaven) that same day. The way to enter into heaven is to believe in Jesus.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think Jesus did not come down from the cross and save himself when the people asked him to?<<ANSWER>>: The people who told Jesus to come down from the cross did not want to believe in him. They were only mocking him. They did not realize that he had the power to come down from the cross. But he came to earth to die for sinners. That was the will of his Father.

People no longer needed to die for their own sins.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why was the curtain of the Temple torn from top to bottom?<<ANSWER>>: The curtain of the Temple prevented people from seeing or entering into the most holy place in the Temple where God was.

He did this to show that Jesus had opened a way for man to approach God through the sacrifice of Jesus.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did the soldier say that Jesus was innocent, and the Son of God?<<ANSWER>>: The Roman soldier had probably executed hundreds of criminals. He recognized that Jesus did not act like a criminal. Instead, he was a good man who asked his Father to forgive the soldiers, and who spoke kindly to the robber who repented. Furthermore, the miraculous signs that happened when Jesus died convinced the soldier that Jesus was not just a man—he was the Son of God.|||
36	Satan Tempts Jesus	Jesus could not die for the sins of other people if he himself were a sinner. Therefore, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness so that Satan could tempt him. God wanted to prove to Satan and everyone else that Jesus never sinned, even though Satan personally tried to make him sin. Jesus was weak, tired, and hungry. Even so, he never sinned. He refused to do what Satan told him to do. He understood when Satan used scripture to try to trick him into testing God.

Satan often uses a person’s weakness when he tries to tempt them.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to fast for 40 days?<<ANSWER>>: God wanted to prove that Jesus would not sin. To show this, he caused Jesus to be weak and hungry. Yet, even though Jesus was weak, he did not sin. He did not do what Satan told him to do. |||<<QUESTION>>: Why did Satan quote from the scripture when he told Jesus to jump off the top of the Temple?<<ANSWER>>: Satan knows the scripture and can quote it. However, he does not use the scripture in the correct way. He tries to give the scripture meanings that God did not intend for it to have. Satan only uses the scripture to deceive people.|||<<QUESTION>>: Did Satan really have the authority to offer all the kingdoms of the world to Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus did not contradict Satan when. There is no reason to believe that Satan cannot give people wealth and power in this world. |||<<QUESTION>>: How was Satan trying to deceive Jesus by offering him all the kingdoms of the world?<<ANSWER>>: The things in this world will end. However, only God can give wealth and power that lasts forever in heaven. Jesus correctly chose to wait until God gave him all the kingdoms of the world so that he could rule forever in heaven. |||<<QUESTION>>: Why was it impossible for Jesus to worship Satan even for a short time in order to receive the kingdoms of this world from Satan?<<ANSWER>>: God demands that people serve him alone. It is never right to serve Satan or anyone else—not even for a short time. We are to worship God only. We sin if we worship anyone or anything other than God.|||
37	Jesus Starts His Ministry	Jesus went to the city of Nazareth in Galilee, the place where he grew up. The people there came together every week to worship God. However, they were not ready to believe that Jesus came from God. When he showed them in the scriptures that he was doing the work of the Messiah, they did not want to believe him. And when Jesus told them that God would accept people from other nations who believed in him, they were so angry that they tried to kill Jesus. Therefore, he left them and went away to preach to other people in Galilee. Many saw the works he did and believed in him. From those who believed, Jesus then chose 12 men to be with him as his apostles.

Did that influence how the people responded to him when he claimed to be the Messiah?<<ANSWER>>: Because the people of Nazareth knew Jesus when he was a little boy, they continued to think of him as an unimportant person. Therefore, it was hard for them to believe that he was the Messiah. For this reason, Jesus said that people do not accept a prophet in the town where he grew up. Have you seen this happen?|||<<QUESTION>>: Jesus did not directly tell the people of Nazareth that he was the Messiah. Instead, he read the scripture and said it was happening right then. Why do you think Jesus revealed himself in this way?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus knew that the people of Nazareth did not want to accept that he was the Messiah. Therefore, instead of stating that as a fact, he read the scripture and said that it was talking about him. If the people of Nazareth wanted to know who he was, they could see that he was doing all the things that the scripture said the Messiah would do. If they were willing to believe in him, they could figure out for themselves from the scripture that he was the Messiah.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why were the Jews so angry when Jesus told them what Elijah and Elisha did?<<ANSWER>>: The Jews believed that God loved only Jews, and would not help people from other nations.

38	God’s Covenant with Israel	God brought the Israelites to Mount Sinai just as he had promised Moses. He came down on the mountain with powerful signs and gave them the Ten Commandments and other laws to obey. He told them how to sacrifice to him, and how to meet him in the Tent of Meeting.

God kept that promise and led them to that same place. |||<<QUESTION>>: Why did God say the Israelites would be a kingdom of priests?<<ANSWER>>: Priests help other people worship God. They also teach people what God has said. All the people of Israel would be able to do these things for the other nations if they would obey God.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why did God write the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone?<<ANSWER>>: God wanted the people to always remember his commandments.

39	Jesus Is Put on Trial	When Jesus was arrested and tried, everyone who should have defended him turned against him instead. The religious leaders rejected the Messiah that God sent to them. Peter denied that he knew Jesus. And Pilate ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus even though he knew that Jesus was innocent. But God used all of these evil things to accomplish his plan. He wanted Jesus to die in order to make a way for God to forgive sinners.

Therefore, they whipped Jesus and prepared to kill him  .|||<<QUESTION>>: What was the only charge the high priest was able to bring against Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Jesus had not done anything wrong, so the high priest could not find true witnesses against him. Finally, he accused Jesus of pretending to be the Messiah and the Son of God. Jesus really was God’s Son, so he was not pretending. He was innocent, but the high priest would not believe him. Therefore, the whole group of religious leaders condemned Jesus.|||<<QUESTION>>: How is it encouraging to followers of Jesus that Peter denied Jesus?<<ANSWER>>: Peter was one of Jesus’ closest disciples. He truly believed in Jesus, and became a leader in the church. However, even Peter denied Jesus when the people accused him. No believer is perfect. Jesus does not expect us to always do the right thing. Just as Jesus loved Peter in spite of his failure, followers of Jesus know he will forgive them when they repent of their sin.|||<<QUESTION>>: Why do you think God allowed Jesus to be falsely accused and condemned?<<ANSWER>>: God knows that people will do evil things, and causes them to do his will. Jesus needed to die so God could forgive sinners. So God allowed the Jewish leaders and the Romans to convict Jesus even though they knew he was innocent. Evil actions do not stop God’s plan or his will from happening.|||
40	The Story of the Unmerciful Servant	Peter asked Jesus how many times he should forgive a fellow disciple who sinned against him. He thought that perhaps seven times would be enough. But Jesus told him that he should continue to forgive his brother even 70 times more than that. Jesus then told a story to show that God is like a king who has forgiven his disciples a great debt of sin. Therefore, his disciples should also forgive their fellow disciples. The debt that they owe each other is much less than the debt they owed to God. If his disciples do not forgive each other, God will be angry with them and will punish them.	<<QUESTION>>: What did Jesus mean when he told Peter to forgive his brother 70 times seven?<<ANSWER>>: When Jesus told Peter to forgive his brother 70 times seven, he wanted to say that Peter should forgive his brother as many times as necessary without stopping  . |||<<QUESTION>>: How would the king get his money back by selling the servant and his family as slaves?<<ANSWER>>: The king would take the money that he would receive from selling the man and his family as slaves.

That seemed like a lot to Peter. However, Jesus answered that seven times was not enough. Disciples of Jesus should forgive 70 times more than that. That is, they should forgive their brothers without limit.|||<<QUESTION>>: How did the debts of the two servants compare to each other?<<ANSWER>>: The debt of the first servant was so large that it would be impossible to repay. The debt of the second servant was significant, but not impossible to pay. |||<<QUESTION>>: Who do you think the king and the servants represent in this story?<<ANSWER>>: In this story, the king represents God. The servants represent the disciples of Jesus. Every disciple owed God a payment for his sin that was impossible to pay, just as the servant owed the king a huge debt.

41	The Divided Kingdom	Solomon began as a good and wise king who ruled Israel well. However, he married many women who worshiped foreign gods. Eventually, Solomon also began to worship these idols.

Jeroboam made idols so the people would not go to Jerusalem to worship Yahweh at the Temple. All the kings of the kingdom of Israel were evil.

Perhaps they were curious about why other people were coming to see him. Or perhaps they were jealous that people were coming to John instead of coming to them. We know John did not think the leaders came for good reasons, because he called them poisonous snakes. Even today, some people come to hear preaching for evil reasons.|||<<QUESTION>>: How did John show that he was a humble man?<<ANSWER>>: John openly said that he was not the Messiah, and that he was not worthy to untie the sandals of the Messiah. He also told Jesus that he was not worthy to baptize him. John is an example for us. He was a great prophet, but he knew the Messiah was greater than he was.|||<<QUESTION>>: How can Jesus be both the Messiah and the Lamb of God?<<ANSWER>>: The Messiah is the only person who did not sin. Therefore, he was the only one who could be a perfect sacrifice to God. In that way, he was punished for the sins of everyone in the world who believes in him. |||<<QUESTION>>: Why did the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit appear together when Jesus was baptized?<<ANSWER>>: By appearing together, they demonstrated that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all working together to save people from their sins, and to enable them to enter into the kingdom of God. When Jesus was baptized, he was doing what God the Father wanted him to do. The Holy Spirit guided Jesus to prepare him to do the work of the Messiah and to become the Lamb of God. |||
