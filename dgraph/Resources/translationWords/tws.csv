For example, James emphasizes that he is talking about all believers when he refers to "a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing."

The terms "uncircumcised" and "uncircumcision" refer to a male who has not been physically circumcised. These terms are also used figuratively.  * Egypt was a nation that also required circumcision. So when God talks about Egypt being defeated by the "uncircumcised," he is referring to people whom the Egyptians despised for not being circumcised. * The Bible refers to people who have an "uncircumcised heart" or who are "uncircumcised in heart." This a figurative way of saying that these people are not God's people, and are stubbornly disobedient to him.  * If a word for circumcision is used or known in the language, "uncircumcised" could be translated as "not circumcised." * The expression "the uncircumcision" could be translated as "people who are not circumcised" or "people who do not belong to God," depending on the context. * Other ways to translate figurative senses of this term could include "not God's people" or "rebellious like those who don't belong to God" or "people who have no sign of belonging to God." * The expression "uncircumcised in heart" could be translated as "stubbornly rebellious" or "refusing to believe." However, if possible it is best to keep the expression or a similar one since spiritual circumcision is an important concept.

In this context, the term "clean" means that the animal was acceptable to God for use as a sacrifice. * A person who had certain skin diseases would be unclean until the skin was healed enough to no longer be contagious. Instructions for cleansing the skin had to be obeyed in order for that person to be declared "clean" again. * Sometimes "clean" is used figuratively to refer to moral purity.  In the Bible, the term "unclean" is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, eat, or sacrifice.   * God gave the Israelites instructions about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals were not permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice.   * People with certain skin diseases were said to be "unclean" until they were healed.   * If the Israelites touched something "unclean," they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.   * Obeying God's commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites set apart for God's service.   * This physical and ritual uncleanness was also symbolic of moral uncleanness.   * In another figurative sense, an "unclean spirit" refers to an evil spirit.

The term "lawless" describes a person who does not obey laws or rules. When a country or group of people are in a state of "lawlessness," there is widespread disobedience, rebellion, or immorality.  * A lawless person is rebellious and does not obey God's laws. * The apostle Paul wrote that in the last days there will be a "man of lawlessness," or a "lawless one," who will be influenced by Satan to do evil things.

Sometimes the term "wine" also referred to unfermented grape juice. * To make wine, grapes are crushed in a winepress so that the juice comes out. The juice eventually ferments and alcohol forms in it. * In Bible times, wine was the normal drink with meals. It did not have as much alcohol as present-day wine has. * Before wine was served for a meal, it was often mixed with water. * A wineskin that was old and brittle would get cracks in it, which allowed the wine to leak out. New wineskins were soft and flexible, which meant they did not tear easily and could store the wine safely. * If wine is unknown in your culture, it could be translated as "fermented grape juice" or "fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes" or "fermented fruit juice." (See: How to Translate Unknowns) * Ways to translate "wineskin" could include "bag for wine" or "animal skin wine bag" or "animal skin container for wine."

1038	winepress	other	winepress	During Bible times, a "winepress" was a large container or open place where the juice of grapes was extracted in order to make wine.  * In Israel, winepresses were usually large, wide basins that were dug out of solid rock. Clusters of grapes were put on the flat bottom of the hole and people trampled the grapes with their feet to get the grape juice to flow out. * Usually a winepress had two levels, with the grapes being trampled in the top level so that the juice would run down into the lower level where it could be collected. * The term "winepress" is also used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of God's wrath being poured out on wicked people.

In the Bible, both words are also used in a figurative sense to refer to separating or dividing people.  * To "winnow" means to separate grain from the unwanted parts of the plant by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. * The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to get rid of any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones. * In the Old Testament, "winnow" and "sift" are used figuratively to describe hardship that separates the righteous people from the unrighteous people. * Jesus also used the term "sift" in this figurative way when he was telling Simon Peter about how he and the other disciples would be tested in their faith. * To translate these terms, use the words or phrases in the project language that refer to these activities; possible translations might be "shaking" or "fanning." If winnowing or sifting are not known, then these terms could be translated by a term that refers to a different method of separating grain from chaff or dirt, or by describing this process.

This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God. * The "wise men" who served pharaohs and other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky. * Often wise men were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel who had received this knowledge from God. * Sometimes wise men also performed magical acts such as divination or miracles that were done through the power of evil spirits. * In the New Testament, the group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus were called "magi," which is often translated as "wise men," since this probably refers to scholars who served a ruler of an eastern country. * It is very probable that these men were astrologers who studied the stars. Some have thought that they may have been descendants of the wise men whom Daniel taught when he was in Babylon. * Depending on the context, the term "wise men" could be translated using the term "wise" or with a phrase such as "gifted men" or "educated men" or some other term that refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler. * When "wise men" is simply a noun phrase, the word "wise" should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.   )	['H2445', 'H2450', 'H3778', 'H3779', 'G4680']	 babylon, daniel, divination, magic, nebuchadnezzar, ruler, wise	* 1 Chronicles 27:32-34* Daniel 02:1-2* Daniel 02:10-11

False teaching causes people to believe wrong things that bring harm to them. * This comparison is based on the fact that sheep are especially vulnerable to being attacked and eaten by wolves, because they are weak and cannot defend themselves.

"Yeast" is a specific kind of leaven.  * In some English translations, the word for leaven is translated as "yeast," which is a modern leavening agent that fills the bread dough with gas bubbles, making the dough expand before baking it. The yeast is kneaded into the dough so that it spreads throughout the entire lump of dough. * In Old Testament times, the leavening or rising agent was produced by allowing the dough to sit for awhile. Small amounts of dough from a previous batch of dough were saved as leavening for the next batch. * When the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they didn't have time to wait for bread dough to rise, so they made bread without leaven to take with them on their journey. As a reminder of this, every year the Jewish people celebrate Passover by eating bread that has no leaven in it. * The term "leaven" or "yeast" is used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of how sin spreads through a person's life or how sin can influence other people. * It can also refer to false teaching which often spreads to many people and influences them. * The term "leaven" is also used in a positive way to explain how the influence of God's kingdom spreads from person to person.
